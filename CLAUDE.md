# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AI Task Workflow

### 1. Project Understanding (Mandatory - Updated for Consolidated Documentation)
Before starting any task, you MUST read and understand the following documents to grasp the project's goals, scope, and current state.

**ðŸ“‹ Master Documents (Start Here)**:
- **Project Overview**: PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md (consolidated project vision, architecture, and status)
- **Task Management**: UNIFIED-TASK-TRACKING.md (integrated task tracking for all development phases)
- **Documentation Hub**: family-tree/docs/index.md (AI-optimized navigation and quick start)

**ðŸ”§ Supporting References**:
- **Success Criteria**: family-tree/docs/success-criteria.md (quality standards and acceptance criteria)
- **Implementation Archive**: family-tree/docs/completed-tasks.md (historical patterns and examples)

### 2. Task-Specific Instructions (Enhanced for Multi-Phase Development)
For any given task ID (e.g., "Task 3.1", "E2-T3"), you MUST:

**For Original Development Tasks (Task X.Y format)**:
1. Read UNIFIED-TASK-TRACKING.md section "Original Development Phases"
2. Check the specific phase (1-4) for task details and dependencies
3. Review family-tree/docs/completed-tasks.md for related implementation patterns

**For Improvement Plan Tasks (EX-TY format)**:
1. Read UNIFIED-TASK-TRACKING.md section "Improvement Plan Epics"  
2. Check the specific epic (E1-E4) for task details and agent assignments
3. Review IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md for detailed acceptance criteria

**For Both Task Types**:
4. Understand task description, status, dependencies, and acceptance criteria
5. Check agent assignments and role-specific requirements
6. Verify prerequisites are met before proceeding
7. Only proceed with implementation after confirming complete understanding

## Task Detail Location Guide

**Before starting any task, follow this lookup flow:**

1. **Task Assignment**: "Do Task 2.2 (P1-CRITICAL): Global State Management"
2. **Quick Status Check**: Read UNIFIED-TASK-TRACKING.md for current status
3. **Get Full Details**:
   - **Original Tasks (Task X.Y)**: Read family-tree/docs/task-tracking.md
   - **Improvement Tasks (EX-TY)**: Read IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md
4. **Proceed**: Only start implementation after reading full acceptance criteria

**Example Command Flow**:
```
"Read CLAUDE.md, follow the task workflow, then do Task 3.1"
```

**Detail Lookup Examples**:
- Task 2.2 details â†’ family-tree/docs/task-tracking.md (lines 110-127)
- Task 3.1 details â†’ family-tree/docs/task-tracking.md (lines 249-260)
- E1-T5 details â†’ IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md (lines 307-326)
- E3-T1 details â†’ IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md (lines 467-485)

### 3. Task Status Updates (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)
**CRITICAL**: You MUST complete ALL steps below in EXACT ORDER. Do NOT proceed to git operations without completing documentation updates first.

**Required Steps (Must Complete in Order):**
- [ ] **Step 1 - Complete Code Implementation**: Finish writing all code changes for the task.
- [ ] **Step 2 - Update Documentation (MANDATORY BEFORE GIT)**: After code is complete but BEFORE any git operations, you MUST update the following:
  - [ ] Update the task's status in `family-tree/docs/task-tracking.md`
  - [ ] Update Improvement Plan entries in `IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md` for any E?-T? task you completed using the standardized completed-task format (see template below)
  - [ ] Move or summarize the completed task in `family-tree/docs/completed-tasks.md` with an anchor and concise notes; if the tracker has full details, keep the archive succinct
  - [ ] Document any issues encountered or deviations from the original plan
  - [ ] Update documentation with your latest achievements
- [ ] **Step 3 - Perform Git Operations**: ONLY after ALL documentation is updated, proceed with git commits and pushes.

**WARNING**: Skipping Step 2 documentation updates is a critical workflow violation. Always verify documentation is updated before any git commit.

#### Standard Format for Improvement Tasks (Completed)
When an Improvement task (E?-T?) is marked Completed, enforce this structure in `IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md` and mirror a concise entry in `family-tree/docs/completed-tasks.md`:

```
### E{epic}-T{task}: {Title} (P{priority}-{level}) âœ…
- Status: Completed - {YYYY-MM-DD} | Branch: `{branch-name}`
- Summary: {Oneâ€“two lines; what changed and impact}
- Details: See Completed Log â†’ [E{epic}-T{task}](family-tree/docs/completed-tasks.md#e{epic}-t{task})
```

In `completed-tasks.md`, ensure an anchor exists:

```
<a id="e{epic}-t{task}"></a>
#### E{epic}-T{task}: {Title} (P{priority}-{level})
- Status: Completed - {YYYY-MM-DD} | Branch: `{branch-name}`
- Summary: {Concise result}
- {Optional sections}: Implementation Notes | Verification Notes | PO Sign-off Notes
```

Notes:
- Prefer concise summaries in the archive when `IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md` already contains full details.
- The `IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md` format should match the style used by entries like `E9-T8` (Title + Priority + âœ…, followed by Status | Branch, Summary, and Details link).

## Working Directory

The main application code is located in the `family-tree/` subdirectory. Always work from `/Users/nouking/Workspace/family-tree/Khoa-family-tree/family-tree` when running commands or editing application files.

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow (Mandatory)
1. **Create a Branch**: Before writing any code, create a feature branch.
   - **Format**: `task{ID}-{kebab-case-description}`
   - **Example**: `task1-1-setup-nextjs-project`
2. **Commit Changes**: Write clear and concise commit messages.
   - **Format**: `type(scope): description`
   - **Example**: `feat(auth): implement jwt token generation`
3. **Create a Pull Request**: After pushing your changes, create a PR. The description should include task details and not mention Claude


## Development Commands & Architecture

- **Architecture Overview**: See `family-tree/docs/project-overview.md` - comprehensive tech stack and structure
- **Project Goals**: See `project-goal.md` - detailed technical architecture and data models

## Task Status Values
- `Pending`: Not yet started
- `In Progress`: Currently being worked on
- `Completed`: Finished successfully
- `Blocked`: Unable to proceed
- `Error`: Task failed and needs resolution
