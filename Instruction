 Build a new “v2” UI in parallel from the three prompt screens:
 -Home screen: login-screen-prompt
 -Help panel: help-panel-prompt
 -Add screen: add-screen-prompt
 -Edit screen: edit-screen-prompt
 -Member detail screen: member-detail-prompt
 -Login screen: login-screen-prompt.

 Build new UI base on those prompt screens. Work in v2 folder. The logic of function is same as v1. Can discuss with me to improve logic if needed. Create a UI v2 plan to note down the UI design and logic. and Epic and task list. Can delete content in family-tree\docs\ui-improvement-plan.md and write new UI v2 plan. Task will put in IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md, can delete Epic 12 and create a new one base on our plan. Make sure plan has detail and good plan. Use MCP context7
