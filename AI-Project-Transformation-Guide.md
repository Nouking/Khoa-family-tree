## **Phase 1: Discovery & Research**

### **🔍 Step 1.1: Analyze Initial Idea**

**Input:** Simple project description (like `@Instruction` file)

**Process:**
1. **Read and Parse** the initial idea document
2. **Extract Core Requirements** from the description
3. **Identify Key Technologies** mentioned or implied
4. **Determine Project Scope** and complexity level

**Example Analysis** (Real Implementation):
```yaml
# From Family Tree Design Tool transformation:
Project_Type: "Canvas-Based Family Tree Design Tool"
Technologies: 
  - "Next.js 15.4.5 (App Router + Turbopack)"
  - "TypeScript 5 (Full type safety)"
  - "Tailwind CSS 4 (Utility-first responsive design)"
  - "React DnD 16.0.1 (Canvas interactions)"
  - "JWT Authentication with bcryptjs"

**Enhanced CLAUDE.md Structure** (Proven Implementation):
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AI Task Workflow

### 1. Project Understanding (Mandatory - Enhanced Documentation)
Before starting any task, you MUST read and understand the following documents to grasp the project's goals, scope, and current state.

**📋 Master Documents (Start Here)**:
- **Project Overview**: PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md (consolidated project vision, architecture, and status)
- **Task Management**: UNIFIED-TASK-TRACKING.md (integrated task tracking for all development phases)
- **Documentation Hub**: [project]/docs/index.md (AI-optimized navigation and quick start)

**🔧 Supporting References**:
- **Success Criteria**: [project]/docs/success-criteria.md (quality standards and acceptance criteria)
- **Implementation Archive**: [project]/docs/completed-tasks.md (historical patterns and examples)

### 2. Task-Specific Instructions (Enhanced for Multi-Phase Development)
For any given task ID (e.g., "Task 3.1", "E2-T3"), you MUST:

**For Original Development Tasks (Task X.Y format)**:
1. Read UNIFIED-TASK-TRACKING.md section "Original Development Phases"
2. Check the specific phase (1-4) for task details and dependencies
3. Review [project]/docs/completed-tasks.md for related implementation patterns

**For Improvement Plan Tasks (EX-TY format)**:
1. Read UNIFIED-TASK-TRACKING.md section "Improvement Plan Epics"  
2. Check the specific epic (E1-E4) for task details and agent assignments
3. Review IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md for detailed acceptance criteria

**For Both Task Types**:
4. Understand task description, status, dependencies, and acceptance criteria
5. Check agent assignments and role-specific requirements
6. Verify prerequisites are met before proceeding
7. Only proceed with implementation after confirming complete understanding

## Task Detail Location Guide

**Before starting any task, follow this lookup flow:**

1. **Task Assignment**: "Do Task 2.2 (P1-CRITICAL): [Task Description]"
2. **Quick Status Check**: Read UNIFIED-TASK-TRACKING.md for current status
3. **Get Full Details**:
   - **Original Tasks (Task X.Y)**: Read [project]/docs/task-tracking.md
   - **Improvement Tasks (EX-TY)**: Read IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md
4. **Proceed**: Only start implementation after reading full acceptance criteria

### 3. Task Status Updates (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)
**CRITICAL**: You MUST complete ALL steps below in EXACT ORDER. Do NOT proceed to git operations without completing documentation updates first.

**Required Steps (Must Complete in Order):**
- [ ] **Step 1 - Complete Code Implementation**: Finish writing all code changes for the task.
- [ ] **Step 2 - Update Documentation (MANDATORY BEFORE GIT)**: After code is complete but BEFORE any git operations, you MUST update the following:
  - [ ] Update the task's status in `[project]/docs/task-tracking.md`
  - [ ] Move the completed task details to `[project]/docs/completed-tasks.md`, including any implementation notes
  - [ ] Document any issues encountered or deviations from the original plan
  - [ ] Update documentation with your latest achievements
- [ ] **Step 3 - Perform Git Operations**: ONLY after ALL documentation is updated, proceed with git commits and pushes.

**WARNING**: Skipping Step 2 documentation updates is a critical workflow violation. Always verify documentation is updated before any git commit.

## Working Directory

The main application code is located in the `[project]/` subdirectory. Always work from the application directory when running commands or editing application files.

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow (Mandatory)
1. **Create a Branch**: Before writing any code, create a feature branch.
   - **Format**: `task{ID}-{kebab-case-description}`
   - **Example**: `task1-1-setup-nextjs-project`
2. **Commit Changes**: Write clear and concise commit messages.
   - **Format**: `type(scope): description`
   - **Example**: `feat(auth): implement jwt token generation`
3. **Create a Pull Request**: After pushing your changes, create a PR. The description should include task details.

## Development Commands & Architecture
