# Family Tree UI Enhancement Plan

> **Agent-Ready UI Improvement Plan** - Structured for @pm, @po, @ux-expert, @architect workflow integration

This document provides a comprehensive plan to enhance the Family Tree application's user interface and experience based on analysis of the current UI (`example/UI-family-tree-08-08-2025.jpg`) and existing project structure.

## Status & Source of Truth (Updated 2025-08-10)
- This plan is supplementary. The authoritative, always-up-to-date tracker is `IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md`.
- For current statuses, acceptance criteria, and branches, see `IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md` and spec notes in `family-tree/docs/implementation-notes.md`.
- Current sync highlights:
  - Epic 5 (Design System Foundation, Member Cards, Toolbar, Canvas) ‚Äî Completed; tokens live in `app/globals.css`.
  - Epic 6 (Enhanced Modal System, etc.) ‚Äî Completed; modal focus trap and animations in place.
  - Epic 10 (Add/Edit Modal UI Redesign) ‚Äî Active. E10-T3 Modal Shell Polish completed on branch `improvement-e10-t3-modal-shell-polish`.
    - Spec: `family-tree/docs/implementation-notes.md` ‚Üí ‚ÄúModal Redesign (E10-T1)‚Äù and `family-tree/docs/assets/e10-modal/annotations.md`.
    - Code: `app/components/Modal.tsx` updated (header accent, backdrop blur, focus styles, tokens).

## üìã Current UI Analysis Summary

### Strengths ‚úÖ
- Clean, minimal navigation with clear hierarchy
- Proper family relationship connections with visual lines

## Integration with Existing Task System üîÑ

### Task Numbering Convention
- UI improvement tasks use **E5-E8** to avoid conflicts with existing **E1-E4** epics
- Maintains same branch naming: `improvement-e5-t1-design-system-foundation`
- Follows established agent assignment patterns

### Dependencies with Existing Tasks
- **E5-T2** can leverage **E1-T5** (Shared Form Component) if completed
- **E6-T2** benefits from **E1-T6** (Member Display Consolidation) 
- **E7-T4** builds on **E4-T2** (Canvas Rendering Optimization)

### Agent Workflow Integration
All tasks follow established patterns:
- **Primary Agent**: Takes ownership and drives implementation
- **Supporting Agents**: Provide expertise and validation
- **Dependencies**: Clear prerequisite task completion
- **Branch Strategy**: Follows existing naming convention

---

## Implementation Guidelines üìã

### Design System First Approach
1. **Foundation Tasks (E5-T1)** must be completed before visual enhancement tasks
2. **Design tokens** should be established in CSS custom properties/Tailwind config
3. **Component library** should be updated systematically across all UI elements

### Mobile-First Implementation
1. **Start with mobile designs** and scale up to desktop
2. **Touch targets** must meet WCAG accessibility standards (44px minimum)
3. **Performance** considerations are critical for mobile devices

### Progressive Enhancement
1. **Core functionality** must work without advanced UI features
2. **Animations** should be optional and respect user preferences
3. **Themes** should degrade gracefully if system doesn't support them

### Quality Assurance Protocol
1. **Design review** with @ux-expert before implementation
2. **Accessibility testing** with @qa for all interactive elements  
3. **Cross-device testing** on mobile, tablet, and desktop
4. **Performance validation** to ensure no regressions
