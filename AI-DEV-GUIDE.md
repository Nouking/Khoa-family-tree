# AI Development Guide - Family Tree Website

> **Note:** This documentation has been restructured for better organization and maintainability.
> Please refer to the new documentation structure in the `family-tree/docs/` directory.

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is now organized into logical sections:

- [Index](./family-tree/docs/index.md) - Main documentation hub with links to all sections
- [Project Overview](./family-tree/docs/project-overview.md) - Project summary, tech stack, and architecture
- [Task Tracking](./family-tree/docs/task-tracking.md) - Current tasks and their status
- [Completed Tasks](./family-tree/docs/completed-tasks.md) - Archive of finished tasks with implementation notes
- [Implementation Notes](./family-tree/docs/implementation-notes.md) - Technical implementation details and code examples
- [Success Criteria](./family-tree/docs/success-criteria.md) - Project goals and metrics for success

## Why Restructure?

The original AI-DEV-GUIDE.md file was growing too large and becoming difficult to maintain as the project progressed. By splitting the documentation into logical components, we've made it:

1. **More maintainable** - Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the project
2. **Easier to navigate** - Clear organization makes finding information faster
3. **More scalable** - New documentation can be added without overwhelming a single file
4. **Better for collaboration** - Multiple team members can work on different documentation sections

## Current Project Status

**Overall Status**: Phase 1 Development in Progress  
**Next Action**: Begin Task 1.4 - MemberCard Component  
**Focus**: Build public viewing first, then add authentication  
**Priority Tasks**: Tasks 1.4 through 1.6 (Foundation Phase)
