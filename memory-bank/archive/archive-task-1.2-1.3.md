# Archive: Tasks 1.2 & 1.3 Completion

**Date**: July 30, 2024  
**Tasks**: Task 1.2 (Project Structure) & Task 1.3 (Sample Data Setup)  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Agent**: Setup_Specialist & Data_Specialist  

## Task 1.2 - Project Structure

### **Objective**
Create basic file structure and directories for the Next.js 15 Family Tree project.

### **Implementation Details**
- ✅ Created `/data` directory with sample JSON files
- ✅ Created `/types` directory with TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Created `/app/components` directory for React components
- ✅ Created `/app/lib` directory for utilities and helpers
- ✅ Implemented `middleware.ts` for route protection
- ✅ Created basic pages (home, login, view) with proper structure
- ✅ All configuration files properly configured:
  - `next.config.ts`
  - `tailwind.config.js`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `eslint.config.mjs`
  - `postcss.config.mjs`

### **Key Files Created**
```
family-tree/
├── app/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── MemberCard.tsx
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── auth.ts
│   │   └── data.ts
│   ├── login/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── view/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── data/
│   ├── family-tree.json
│   └── users.json
├── types/
│   └── index.ts
└── middleware.ts
```

### **Technical Decisions**
- Used Next.js 15 App Router structure
- Implemented proper TypeScript configuration
- Added middleware for future route protection
- Created responsive design foundation with Tailwind CSS

## Task 1.3 - Sample Data Setup

### **Objective**
Setup JSON data files with realistic Vietnamese family data.

### **Implementation Details**
- ✅ Created `family-tree.json` with 6 family members
- ✅ Created `users.json` with bcrypt-hashed admin password
- ✅ Implemented complete family structure with proper relationships
- ✅ Added Vietnamese names and realistic family hierarchy
- ✅ All data follows TypeScript interface specifications

### **Family Tree Data Structure**
```json
{
  "id": "family-tree-1",
  "name": "Lê Family Tree",
  "createdAt": "2024-07-30",
  "updatedAt": "2024-07-30",
  "members": [
    {
      "id": "member-1",
      "name": "Lê Thành Công",
      "gender": "male",
      "birthDate": "1950-01-01",
      "title": "Patriarch",
      "parentId": null,
      "spouseIds": ["member-2"],
      "childrenIds": ["member-3", "member-4"],
      "order": 1
    }
    // ... 5 more family members
  ]
}
```

### **Family Members Included**
1. **Lê Thành Công** (Patriarch) - Married to Nguyễn Thị Hương
2. **Nguyễn Thị Hương** (Matriarch) - Married to Lê Thành Công
3. **Lê Minh Tuấn** (Eldest Son) - Married to Trần Thị Hoa
4. **Lê Thị Mai** (Daughter) - Single
5. **Trần Thị Hoa** (Daughter-in-law) - Married to Lê Minh Tuấn
6. **Lê Minh Quân** (Grandson) - Child of Lê Minh Tuấn

### **User Data Structure**
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "user-1",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "$2b$10$XdRXcGJO.GiZ0B.7VdPDAu2nVKwevd3yTKp.jQoQAdaW3d4a/Lhja",
      "role": "editor",
      "createdAt": "2024-07-30T00:00:00Z",
      "lastLogin": "2024-07-30T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Technical Decisions**
- Used bcrypt with 10 salt rounds for password hashing
- Implemented realistic Vietnamese family names and relationships
- Created proper parent-child and spouse relationships
- Added comprehensive member information (birth dates, titles, contact info)
- Ensured data integrity with TypeScript interface compliance

## Impact on Project

### **Foundation Complete**
- ✅ All setup tasks completed (Tasks 1.1-1.3)
- ✅ Project structure ready for UI development
- ✅ Sample data available for testing and development
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces defined and implemented
- ✅ Authentication foundation prepared

### **Next Steps**
- **Task 1.4**: Begin MemberCard component development
- **Task 1.5**: Implement tree layout system
- **Task 1.6**: Add responsive design features

### **Dependencies Resolved**
- No blockers for UI development
- All required directories and files created
- Sample data available for component testing
- TypeScript configuration complete

## Lessons Learned

### **Project Structure**
- Next.js 15 App Router provides excellent organization
- TypeScript interfaces should be defined early
- Middleware setup is crucial for future authentication
- Proper directory structure improves maintainability

### **Data Design**
- Realistic sample data improves development experience
- Proper relationship modeling is essential for family trees
- Vietnamese names add cultural authenticity
