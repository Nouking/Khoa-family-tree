## What's Left to Build

### Current Sprint (Phase 1 - Migration & Foundation)
- ‚è≥ **Next.js 15 Migration (Tasks 1.7-1.12)** - Critical foundation for canvas system
  - Task 1.7: Next.js 15 API Routes - Update to new App Router patterns
  - Task 1.8: Page Components Migration - Implement Server Components where appropriate
  - Task 1.9: Codemod Application - Use official Next.js 15 migration tools
  - Task 1.10: Enhanced Data Structure - Add position, size, relationship fields to TypeScript interfaces
  - Task 1.11: Data Migration Utility - Convert existing JSON to new format
  - Task 1.12: Canvas Foundation - Basic canvas setup with drag-and-drop types

### Next Sprint (Phase 2 - Canvas & UI Enhancement)
- ‚è≥ **Canvas Implementation (Task 2.1)** - Interactive canvas with drag-and-drop positioning
- ‚è≥ **Professional Toolbar (Task 2.2)** - Design tool header with essential actions
- ‚è≥ **Enhanced Member Banners (Task 2.3)** - Rounded banners with relationship labels
- ‚è≥ **Viewport Controls (Task 2.4)** - Pan, zoom, and canvas navigation
- ‚è≥ **History Stack (Task 2.5)** - Undo/redo functionality with state management
- ‚è≥ **Grid System (Task 2.6)** - Professional grid with snap-to-grid functionality

### Future Sprints (Phase 3-4)
- ‚è≥ **CRUD Operations (Phase 3)** - Modal-based add/edit/delete with form validation
- ‚è≥ **State Management (Phase 3)** - React Context with history stack for undo/redo
- ‚è≥ **Share System (Phase 4)** - Generate and manage shareable URLs
- ‚è≥ **Export Features (Phase 4)** - CSV and high-quality image export
- ‚è≥ **Mobile Optimization (Phase 4)** - Touch interactions and mobile-specific UI

## Known Issues

- None at this time - foundation is solid and ready for transformation

## Recent Achievements

  - Responsive design patterns that will inform canvas implementation
  - SVG connection system that will be enhanced for canvas positioning
  - Data structure that will be extended with position/size fields
  - Testing infrastructure that will support canvas component testing

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Next.js 15 Migration (Tasks 1.7-1.12)**
   - Update API routes to Next.js 15 App Router patterns
   - Migrate page components to use Server Components where appropriate
   - Apply official Next.js 15 codemods for compatibility
   - Enhance TypeScript interfaces with position, size, and relationship fields
   - Create data migration utility for existing family tree data
   - Set up canvas foundation with drag-and-drop types

2. **Begin Canvas Implementation (Phase 2)**
   - Implement interactive canvas with absolute positioning
   - Create professional toolbar with essential design tool actions
   - Transform MemberCard to enhanced MemberBanner with relationship labels
   - Add viewport controls for pan and zoom functionality
   - Implement undo/redo system with history stack
   - Add professional grid system with snap functionality

3. **Implement CRUD Operations (Phase 3)**
   - Set up React Context for global state management
   - Create modal components for add/edit/delete operations
   - Implement core CRUD operations with error handling
   - Add member selection and multi-select functionality
   - Implement position management on canvas
