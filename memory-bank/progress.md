# Project Progress

## Current Status

- **Project Phase**: Foundation (Phase 1)
- **Current Sprint**: Week 1-2 - Public family tree viewing functionality
- **Progress**: 83% complete (5/6 foundation tasks completed)
- **Next Task**: Task 1.6 - Responsive Design

## What Works

- ✅ Project setup with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Project structure with app router, components, and data directories
- ✅ Sample data with realistic Vietnamese family structure (6 members)
- ✅ Basic navigation and routing (home, view, login pages)
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- ✅ User authentication data structure with bcrypt hashed passwords
- ✅ MemberCard component with photo display and responsive design
- ✅ **Tree layout system with horizontal layout and SVG connections**
- ✅ **Family tree visualization with parent-child and spouse relationships**
- ✅ **Horizontally scrollable tree for large families**
- ✅ **Comprehensive unit tests for tree components**
- ✅ **Complete data utilities with CRUD operations**
- ✅ **Vietnamese family sample data with realistic relationships**

## What's Left to Build

### Current Sprint (Foundation)
- ⏳ **Responsive Design (Task 1.6)** - Mobile/tablet/desktop adaptations
  - Implement mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
  - Ensure tree layout works on all device sizes
  - Optimize SVG connections for different screen sizes
  - Consider alternative layouts for very small screens

### Next Sprint (Authentication)
- ⏳ Auth API Routes (Task 2.2)
- ⏳ JWT Token System (Task 2.3)
- ⏳ Login Form Component (Task 2.4)
- ⏳ Auth Middleware (Task 2.5)
- ⏳ Logout Functionality (Task 2.6)

## Known Issues

- None at this time

## Recent Achievements
