## Known Issues

- None at this time - Phase 1 is fully completed and verified, ready to proceed to Phase 2.

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ **Task 1.13: Viewport Controls (Pan & Zoom)**: Implemented viewport controls with state management for x, y, and zoom values. Added UI controls and mouse events for intuitive canvas navigation. **This task is now fully completed and verified.**
