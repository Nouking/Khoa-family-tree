# Project Progress

## Current Status

- **Project Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation Complete, Phase 2 - Canvas & UI Enhancement In Progress
- **Current Sprint**: Week 3 - Canvas & UI Enhancement (continuing with Task 2.1)
- **Progress**: **100% complete for Phase 1**, 50% complete for Phase 2
- **Next Task**: Task 2.1 - CRUD API Endpoints
- **Transformation Goal**: Converting basic family tree viewer into professional design tool

## What Works

- ✅ **Task 1.15: Professional Toolbar**: Created the main `MainToolbar` component with essential actions like Home, Undo/Redo placeholders, Share, Export, and Add Member. Implemented responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes with proper event handlers and button styling. Integrated the toolbar with the view page using a client/server component split.
- ✅ **Task 1.14: Enhanced Member Banners**: Redesigned the `MemberCard` into an enhanced `MemberBanner` component with relationship labels and professional styling. Added hover effects with blue border highlights and support for title display. Updated the `FamilyTree` component to set proper size properties for banners and added comprehensive test coverage.
- ✅ **Task 1.13: Viewport Controls (Pan & Zoom)**: Implemented viewport controls for panning and zooming the canvas with UI buttons and mouse drag support. Added zoom level indicator and constrained zoom levels for optimal user experience. Used CSS transforms for efficient rendering with transform-origin centered for intuitive zooming.
- ✅ **Task 1.12: Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Added drag-and-drop for `MemberCard` components using `react-dnd` and updated member positions in state. Mock files for testing were created. The component now correctly updates the member's `position` in the state upon successful drop.
- ✅ **Task 1.11: Basic Canvas Component**: `FamilyTreeCanvas` component created and renders members using absolute positioning, and a connections SVG layer has been added. This forms the foundational canvas for the new design tool.
- ✅ **All Migration Tasks (1.1-1.10)**: Successfully completed Next.js 15 migration
  - Enhanced data structure with position, size, and relationship fields
  - Data migration utility for converting existing JSON to new format
  - API routes and page components migrated to Next.js 15 patterns
  - Codemods applied for Next.js 15 compatibility
  - Foundation components (MemberCard, FamilyTree, TreeConnection) completed
  - Sample data with 6 Vietnamese family members and realistic relationships
  - Responsive design foundation with viewport detection and adaptive spacing
  - Complete data utilities with CRUD operations
  - Comprehensive unit tests with TDD principles
- ✅ **Project Infrastructure**: Solid foundation ready for transformation
  - Next.js 15 setup with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - Project structure with app router, components, and data directories
  - Authentication dependencies (JWT, bcrypt) installed and configured
  - Testing infrastructure with Jest and comprehensive test coverage
  - TypeScript interfaces and type definitions complete
  - User authentication data structure with bcrypt hashed passwords
