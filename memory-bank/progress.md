# Project Progress

## Current Status

- **Project Phase**: Phase 1 - Canvas Foundation Completed
- **Current Sprint**: Week 2 - Canvas & UI Enhancement (starting with Task 1.13)
- **Progress**: **100% complete for Phase 1**, 5% complete for Phase 2 (starting)
- **Next Task**: Task 1.13 - Viewport Controls (Pan & Zoom)
- **Transformation Goal**: Converting basic family tree viewer into professional design tool

## What Works

- ✅ **Task 1.12: Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Added drag-and-drop for `MemberCard` components using `react-dnd` and updated member positions in state. Mock files for testing were created. **This task is now fully completed and verified.**
- ✅ **Task 1.11: Basic Canvas Component**: `FamilyTreeCanvas` component created and renders members using absolute positioning, and a connections SVG layer has been added. **This task is now fully completed and verified.**
- ✅ **All Migration Tasks (1.1-1.12)**: Successfully completed Next.js 15 migration
  - Enhanced data structure with position, size, and relationship fields
  - Data migration utility for converting existing JSON to new format
  - API routes and page components migrated to Next.js 15 patterns
  - Codemods applied for Next.js 15 compatibility
  - Foundation components (MemberCard, FamilyTree, TreeConnection) completed
  - Sample data with 6 Vietnamese family members and realistic relationships
  - Responsive design foundation with viewport detection and adaptive spacing
  - Complete data utilities with CRUD operations
  - Comprehensive unit tests with TDD principles
- ✅ **Project Infrastructure**: Solid foundation ready for transformation
  - Next.js 15 setup with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - Project structure with app router, components, and data directories
  - Authentication dependencies (JWT, bcrypt) installed and configured
  - Testing infrastructure with Jest and comprehensive test coverage
  - TypeScript interfaces and type definitions complete
  - User authentication data structure with bcrypt hashed passwords

## What's Left to Build

### Current Sprint (Phase 2 - Canvas & UI Enhancement)
- ⏳ **Canvas & UI Enhancement (Tasks 1.13, 1.14, 1.15)** - Critical foundation for canvas system
  - Task 1.13: Viewport Controls (Pan & Zoom) - Implement panning and zooming
  - Task 1.14: Enhanced Member Banners - Redesign MemberCard into MemberBanner
  - Task 1.15: Professional Toolbar - Create MainToolbar with essential actions

### Next Sprint (Phase 2 - Continued Canvas & UI Enhancement)
- ⏳ **Canvas Implementation (Task 2.5)** - Interactive canvas with drag-and-drop positioning
- ⏳ **Professional Toolbar (Task 2.6)** - Design tool header with essential actions
- ⏳ **History Stack (Task 2.7)** - Undo/redo functionality with state management
- ⏳ **Grid System (Task 2.8)** - Professional grid with snap-to-grid functionality

### Future Sprints (Phase 3-4)
- ⏳ **CRUD Operations (Phase 3)** - Modal-based add/edit/delete with form validation
- ⏳ **State Management (Phase 3)** - React Context with history stack for undo/redo
- ⏳ **Share System (Phase 4)** - Generate and manage shareable URLs
- ⏳ **Export Features (Phase 4)** - CSV and high-quality image export
- ⏳ **Mobile Optimization (Phase 4)** - Touch interactions and mobile-specific UI

## Known Issues

- None at this time - Phase 1 is fully completed and verified, ready to proceed to Phase 2.

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ **Task 1.12: Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Added drag-and-drop for `MemberCard` components using `react-dnd` and updated member positions in state. Mock files for testing were created. **This task is now fully completed and verified.**
- ✅ **Task 1.11: Basic Canvas Component**: Implemented the `FamilyTreeCanvas` component, which now renders members using absolute positioning based on data, and a connections SVG layer has been added. This is the first major step in the canvas-based UI transformation. **This task is now fully completed and verified.**
- ✅ **All Migration Tasks Completed**: Successfully completed Next.js 15 migration with enhanced data structure
- ✅ **Enhanced Data Structure**: Added position, size, and relationship fields to TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ **Data Migration Utility**: Created and executed script to migrate family tree data to new V2 format
- ✅ **Codemod Application**: Applied official Next.js 15 codemods for compatibility
- ✅ **API Routes Migration**: Updated all API routes to Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- ✅ **Page Components Migration**: Verified all page components for Next.js 15 compatibility
- ✅ **Foundation Components**: Completed MemberCard, FamilyTree, and TreeConnection components
- ✅ **Sample Data**: 6 Vietnamese family members with realistic relationships
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Foundation with viewport detection and adaptive spacing
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive unit tests with TDD principles
- ✅ **Data Utilities**: Complete CRUD operations for family members

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Phase 2 - Canvas & UI Enhancement**

   - Redesign MemberCard into Enhanced Member Banners (`Task 1.14`)
   - Create the Professional Toolbar (`Task 1.15`)
   - Implement professional grid system with snap functionality (`Task 2.5`)
   - Add undo/redo functionality with history stack (`Task 2.6`)

2. **Implement Phase 3 - CRUD Operations**
   - Set up React Context for global state management (`Task 2.2`)
   - Create modal components for add/edit/delete operations (`Task 2.3`)
