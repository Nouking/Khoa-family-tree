- ✅ **Foundation Components**: Complete implementation of core components
  - MemberCard component with photo display and responsive design
  - FamilyTree component with horizontal layout and SVG connections
  - TreeConnection component for parent-child and spouse relationships
  - Sample data with 6 Vietnamese family members and realistic relationships
  - Responsive design foundation with viewport detection and adaptive spacing
  - Complete data utilities with CRUD operations
  - Comprehensive unit tests with TDD principles
- ✅ **Project Infrastructure**: Solid foundation ready for transformation
  - Next.js 15 setup with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - Project structure with app router, components, and data directories
  - Authentication dependencies (JWT, bcrypt) installed and configured
  - Testing infrastructure with Jest and comprehensive test coverage
  - TypeScript interfaces and type definitions complete
  - User authentication data structure with bcrypt hashed passwords

## What's Left to Build

### Current Sprint (Phase 1 - Canvas Foundation)
- ⏳ **Canvas Foundation (Task 1.12)** - Critical foundation for canvas system
  - Task 1.12: Drag-and-Drop Functionality - Add drag-and-drop for member banners

### Next Sprint (Phase 2 - Canvas & UI Enhancement)
- ⏳ **Canvas Implementation (Task 2.1)** - Interactive canvas with drag-and-drop positioning
- ⏳ **Professional Toolbar (Task 2.2)** - Design tool header with essential actions
- ⏳ **Enhanced Member Banners (Task 2.3)** - Rounded banners with relationship labels
- ⏳ **Viewport Controls (Task 2.4)** - Pan, zoom, and canvas navigation
- ⏳ **History Stack (Task 2.5)** - Undo/redo functionality with state management
- ⏳ **Grid System (Task 2.6)** - Professional grid with snap-to-grid functionality

### Future Sprints (Phase 3-4)
- ⏳ **CRUD Operations (Phase 3)** - Modal-based add/edit/delete with form validation
- ⏳ **State Management (Phase 3)** - React Context with history stack for undo/redo
- ⏳ **Share System (Phase 4)** - Generate and manage shareable URLs
- ⏳ **Export Features (Phase 4)** - CSV and high-quality image export
- ⏳ **Mobile Optimization (Phase 4)** - Touch interactions and mobile-specific UI

## Known Issues

- None at this time - foundation is solid and ready for canvas transformation

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ **Task 1.11: Basic Canvas Component**: Implemented the `FamilyTreeCanvas` component, which now renders members using absolute positioning based on data, and a connections SVG layer has been added. This is the first major step in the canvas-based UI transformation.
- ✅ **All Migration Tasks Completed**: Successfully completed Next.js 15 migration with enhanced data structure
- ✅ **Enhanced Data Structure**: Added position, size, and relationship fields to TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ **Data Migration Utility**: Created and executed script to migrate family tree data to new V2 format
- ✅ **Codemod Application**: Applied official Next.js 15 codemods for compatibility
- ✅ **API Routes Migration**: Updated all API routes to Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- ✅ **Page Components Migration**: Verified all page components for Next.js 15 compatibility
- ✅ **Foundation Components**: Completed MemberCard, FamilyTree, and TreeConnection components
- ✅ **Sample Data**: 6 Vietnamese family members with realistic relationships
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Foundation with viewport detection and adaptive spacing
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive unit tests with TDD principles
- ✅ **Data Utilities**: Complete CRUD operations for family members

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Canvas Foundation (Task 1.12)**
   - Add drag-and-drop functionality for `MemberBanner` components
   - Set up canvas state management with viewport controls
   - Create enhanced member banners with relationship labels

2. **Implement Canvas & UI Enhancement (Phase 2)**
   - Interactive canvas with drag-and-drop positioning
   - Professional toolbar with essential actions
   - Enhanced member banners with relationship labels
   - Viewport controls (pan, zoom) for canvas navigation
   - Undo/redo functionality with history stack
   - Professional grid system with snap functionality

3. **Implement CRUD Operations (Phase 3)**
   - Set up React Context for global state management
   - Create modal components for add/edit/delete operations
   - Implement core CRUD operations with error handling
   - Add member selection and multi-select functionality
   - Implement position management on canvas
   - Create connection management system

## Current Architecture Status
