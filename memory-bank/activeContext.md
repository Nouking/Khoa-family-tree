# Active Context

## Current Focus

**Task 1.6 - Responsive Design**
- Add responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Use Tailwind breakpoints for responsive adaptations
- Ensure the tree visualization works on all screen sizes
- Consider alternative layouts for very small screens
- Implement mobile-first approach to responsive design

## Recent Changes

- ✅ **Completed Task 1.5 (Tree Layout System)** with comprehensive implementation:
  - FamilyTree component with horizontal layout and SVG connections
  - TreeConnection component for parent-child and spouse relationships
  - groupMembersByGeneration function for proper family structure
  - Horizontally scrollable layout for large family trees
  - Comprehensive unit tests with TDD principles
  - Integration with MemberCard component
  - Updated view page to use the new FamilyTree component

- ✅ **Completed Task 1.4 (MemberCard Component)** with:
  - Photo display with fallback avatar
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - Proper TypeScript interfaces
  - Integration into tree layout

- ✅ **Completed Task 1.3 (Sample Data Setup)** with:
  - Realistic Vietnamese family data (6 members)
  - Complete family hierarchy with relationships
  - Proper data validation against TypeScript interfaces

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Task 1.6)**:
   - Implement responsive design for the tree layout
   - Add Tailwind breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Test the tree visualization on different screen sizes
   - Optimize SVG connections for different screen sizes
   - Consider alternative layouts for very small screens

2. **Short-term (Phase 2)**:
   - Begin authentication system implementation
   - Create JWT token system and auth API routes
   - Build login form component with validation
   - Add protected routes for editing functionality

3. **Medium-term (Phase 3)**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for family tree editing
   - Add member creation and editing forms
   - Implement photo upload functionality
   - Add drag-and-drop reordering of siblings

## Active Decisions

- **Responsive Strategy**: Planning how to adapt the tree layout for different screen sizes
- **Authentication Approach**: Evaluating JWT token implementation options
- **Form Validation**: Considering form validation strategies for login and member editing
- **CRUD Operations**: Planning API routes and UI components for family tree editing

## Technical Considerations

- The tree layout must adapt to different screen sizes
- SVG connections need to recalculate when the layout changes
- Authentication system must be secure and user-friendly
- CRUD operations need proper error handling and validation
- Performance optimization for larger family trees

## Current Implementation Status

### **Completed Components**
- ✅ **FamilyTree**: Horizontal tree layout with SVG connections
- ✅ **TreeConnection**: SVG connection lines for family relationships
- ✅ **MemberCard**: Photo display with fallback avatar and responsive design
- ✅ **Data Utilities**: Complete CRUD operations for family members
- ✅ **Sample Data**: 6 Vietnamese family members with realistic relationships

### **Current Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Data Storage**: JSON files with proper error handling
- **Authentication**: JWT and bcrypt dependencies installed
- **Testing**: Jest setup with comprehensive test coverage
- **Tree Layout**: Horizontal layout with generation-based grouping
