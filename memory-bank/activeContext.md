# Active Context

## Current Focus

**Project Transformation**: Converting basic family tree viewer into professional design tool
  - **Current Status**: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 - Canvas & UI Enhancement in progress (50% complete)
- **Foundation**: All Phase 1 tasks (1.1-1.15) completed successfully
- **Next Steps**: Implement CRUD operations (Task 2.1) and global state management (Task 2.2)
- **Priority**: Establish core CRUD functionality and state management for the design tool

## Recent Changes

- âœ… **Completed Phase 1 - Foundation (Tasks 1.1-1.15)**:
  - Next.js 15 setup with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - Enhanced data structure with position, size, and relationship fields
  - Data migration utility for converting existing JSON to new format
  - API routes and page components migrated to Next.js 15 patterns
  - Codemods applied for Next.js 15 compatibility
  - Foundation components (MemberCard, FamilyTree, TreeConnection) completed
  - Sample data with 6 Vietnamese family members and realistic relationships
  - Responsive design foundation with viewport detection and adaptive spacing
  - Complete data utilities with CRUD operations
  - Comprehensive unit tests with TDD principles
  - **Task 1.11: Basic Canvas Component** - Complete (connections layer added)
  - **Task 1.12: Drag-and-Drop Functionality** - Complete (Drag-and-drop implemented)
  - **Task 1.13: Viewport Controls (Pan & Zoom)** - Complete (panning and zooming implemented)
  - **Task 1.14: Enhanced Member Banners** - Complete (professional styling and relationship labels)
  - **Task 1.15: Professional Toolbar** - Complete (essential actions and responsive design)

- ðŸ”„ **In Progress - Phase 2 - CRUD Operations (Tasks 2.1-2.4)**:
  - Task 2.1: CRUD API Endpoints - Create Next.js API routes for all CRUD operations
  - Task 2.2: Global State Management - Implement React Context for family tree data
  - Task 2.3: Modal Components - Create modal-based add/edit/delete operations
  - Task 2.4: Member Selection - Implement member selection and multi-select functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Complete CRUD Operations)**:
   - Implement Next.js API routes for all CRUD operations (`Task 2.1`)
   - Set up React Context for global state management (`Task 2.2`)
   - Create modal components for add/edit/delete operations (`Task 2.3`)
   - Add member selection and multi-select functionality (`Task 2.4`)

2. **Short-term (Phase 2 - Continued Canvas Enhancement)**:
   - Implement interactive canvas with drag-and-drop positioning (`Task 2.5`)
   - Add position management on canvas (`Task 2.6`)
   - Create connection management system (`Task 2.7`)
   - Implement undo/redo functionality with history stack (`Task 2.8`)

3. **Medium-term (Phase 3 - Advanced Features)**:
   - Enhanced form validation and bulk operations
   - Advanced filtering and search capabilities
   - Performance optimization for large family trees
   - Mobile-specific optimizations

4. **Long-term (Phase 4 - Share & Export)**:
   - Share link generation and management
   - CSV and high-quality image export
   - Complete authentication system
   - Mobile optimization with touch interactions

## Active Decisions

- **Canvas Implementation Strategy**: Basic canvas with viewport controls and drag-and-drop is complete
- **Component Architecture**: Enhanced member banners with professional styling implemented
- **State Management**: Ready to implement React Context for canvas state and member data
- **UI/UX Direction**: Professional toolbar with essential actions implemented
- **Mobile Strategy**: Touch-optimized interface with responsive design foundation
- **Performance**: Canvas system with efficient rendering and viewport controls

## Technical Considerations

- Canvas implementation with viewport controls and drag-and-drop is complete
- Enhanced data structure with position/size fields is ready for advanced features
- Professional toolbar design provides foundation for upcoming functionality
- Mobile optimization requires touch event handling and responsive canvas
- State management with React Context needed for CRUD operations
- Export functionality requires canvas-to-image conversion and CSV generation

## Current Implementation Status

### **Completed Components**
- âœ… **MainToolbar**: Professional toolbar with essential actions and responsive design
- âœ… **MemberBanner**: Enhanced member display with relationship labels and professional styling
- âœ… **FamilyTreeCanvas**: Implementation with viewport controls for panning and zooming
- âœ… **FamilyTree**: Horizontal tree layout with SVG connections (foundation for canvas)
- âœ… **TreeConnection**: SVG connection lines for family relationships (to be enhanced)
- âœ… **MemberCard**: Photo display with fallback avatar and responsive design (replaced by MemberBanner)
- âœ… **Data Utilities**: Complete CRUD operations for family members
- âœ… **Sample Data**: 6 Vietnamese family members with realistic relationships
- âœ… **Project Structure**: Complete Next.js 15 setup with proper organization

### **Current Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Data Storage**: JSON files with proper error handling
- **Authentication**: JWT and bcrypt dependencies installed
- **Testing**: Jest setup with comprehensive test coverage
- **Canvas System**: Basic canvas with viewport controls and drag-and-drop functionality
