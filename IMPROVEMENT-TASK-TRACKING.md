- **Supporting Agents**: @architect (Winston - Permission system) - `.cursor/rules/architect.mdc`, @qa (Quinn - UX testing) - `.cursor/rules/qa.mdc`
- **Description**: Implement right-click context menu on family tree members with Edit/View/Delete functionality based on user permissions
- **Dependencies**: [E13-T10] v2 CSS architecture must be consolidated first, [E13-T3] API errors must be resolved, [E13-T5] Modal content needed for Edit functionality
- **Reference Files**:
  - **Target Components**: `family-tree/app/components-v2/MemberBannerV2.tsx` (context menu integration point)
