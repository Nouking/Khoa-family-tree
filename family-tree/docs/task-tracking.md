**Task 2.2 (P1-CRITICAL): Global State Management (React Context)**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Implement a global state management solution using React Context API to handle the family tree data.
- **Details**: Create `FamilyTreeContext` and `FamilyTreeDispatchContext`. Use `useReducer` for state logic. Define action types for all CRUD operations.

**Task 2.3 (P1-CRITICAL): CRUD Member Modals**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Create reusable modal components for Add, Edit, and Delete member operations.
- **Details**: Build a base modal and specific forms for adding and editing members, including validation and photo upload functionality as specified in `upgrade-plan.md`.

**Task 2.4 (P1-CRITICAL): Member Selection & Context Menu**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Implement a system for selecting single and multiple members on the canvas. Add a context menu for quick actions.
- **Details**: Manage selection state in React Context. Use Shift/Ctrl for multi-select. The context menu should show Edit/Delete options.

**Task 2.5 (P1-CRITICAL): Dynamic Connection Recalculation**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Implement logic to dynamically recalculate and re-render the SVG connection lines when members are moved.
- **Details**: This should be triggered after a drag-and-drop operation completes. Optimize to prevent performance issues on large trees.

**Task 2.6 (P2-HIGH): Undo/Redo History Stack**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Implement an undo/redo system for all state-changing actions.
- **Details**: Manage a history of state snapshots (`past`, `present`, `future`). Connect this to the Undo/Redo buttons in the toolbar.

**Task 2.7 (P2-HIGH): Form Validation**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Add client-side validation for all forms in the CRUD modals.
- **Details**: Ensure required fields are filled, data formats are correct, and provide clear error messages to the user.

**Task 2.8 (P3-MEDIUM): Bulk Operations Support**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Add support for performing actions on multiple selected members.
- **Details**: Allow users to delete or apply certain changes to all selected members at once.

## Phase 3: Share & Export (Week 3 | Priority: HIGH)
- **Goal**: Enable comprehensive sharing and export capabilities.
- **Success Criteria**: Users can share and export family trees in multiple formats.

**Task 3.1 (P1-CRITICAL): Share Link System**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Implement a system to generate secure, shareable links for the family tree.
- **Details**: Create a `ShareModal` component. The link should encode the tree identifier. Implement the `/view/[shareCode]` page to load the shared tree.

**Task 3.2 (P1-CRITICAL): CSV Export**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Implement functionality to export the family tree data as a CSV file.
- **Details**: Include all relevant member fields. Create a utility function to convert the JSON data to a CSV string and trigger a download.

**Task 3.3 (P1-CRITICAL): PNG Image Export**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Implement functionality to export the current canvas view as a PNG image.
- **Details**: Use a library like `html2canvas` to capture the family tree container element and convert it to an image for download.

**Task 3.4 (P1-CRITICAL): Export Options Modal**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Create a modal to provide users with options for exporting, such as format (CSV/PNG), image dimensions, and quality.
- **Details**: This modal will be triggered by the 'Export' button in the toolbar.

**Task 3.5 (P2-HIGH): Share Link Validation**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Add validation for share links, with potential for expiry dates or password protection in the future.
- **Details**: For now, focus on robust encoding/decoding to prevent malformed links.

**Task 3.6 (P2-HIGH): Export Watermarking**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Add an option to include a watermark on exported images.
- **Details**: The watermark could be text or a logo, with configurable position and opacity.

**Task 3.7 (P3-MEDIUM): Batch Export**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Allow users to export data for a selection of members instead of the entire tree.
- **Details**: The export functions should be able to accept an array of member IDs to filter the data.

## Phase 4: Mobile Experience (Week 4 | Priority: HIGH)
- **Goal**: Optimize the design tool for mobile devices.
- **Success Criteria**: Full functionality available on mobile with touch support.

**Task 4.1 (P1-CRITICAL): Touch-Optimized Interface**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Adapt the canvas and controls for touch-based interactions.
- **Details**: Implement touch event handlers for drag-and-drop, panning, and selection.

**Task 4.2 (P1-CRITICAL): Mobile Action Bar**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Create a mobile-specific action bar at the bottom of the screen for key actions.
- **Details**: Follow the design in `upgrade-plan.md`, with large, touch-friendly buttons for Add, Share, and Export.

**Task 4.3 (P1-CRITICAL): Touch-Friendly Selection**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Implement intuitive touch gestures for selecting members.
- **Details**: Support tap-to-select and potentially tap-and-hold for multi-select or context menus.

**Task 4.4 (P1-CRITICAL): Mobile-Optimized Modals**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Ensure all modals are responsive and easy to use on small screens.
- **Details**: Modals should take up the full screen width, with larger form inputs and buttons.

**Task 4.5 (P2-HIGH): Pinch-to-Zoom Gesture**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Implement pinch-to-zoom functionality on the canvas for mobile devices.
- **Details**: Use touch events to calculate the distance between fingers and adjust the canvas zoom level.

**Task 4.6 (P2-HIGH): Mobile Performance Optimization**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Profile and optimize canvas performance on mobile browsers.
- **Details**: May involve throttling events, simplifying rendering during interactions, or using `requestAnimationFrame`.

**Task 4.7 (P3-MEDIUM): Offline Support (Future Consideration)**
- **Status**: Pending
- **Description**: Explore options for allowing offline editing on mobile devices.
- **Details**: Could involve using Service Workers and local storage to cache data and sync when back online. This is a lower priority.
