- **Advanced Features**: Batch operations, watermarking, offline support

## Strategic Improvement Framework

### AI Task Management Rules ðŸ¤–

**CRITICAL RULE - MANDATORY FOR ALL AI AGENTS:**

When given any task from this improvement plan, AI MUST:

1. **Task Discovery**: First read `@IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md` to fetch detailed task information
2. **Task Execution**: Implement the task following the acceptance criteria and implementation details
3. **Task Completion**: Update `@IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md` with:
   - Status change to "Completed" 
   - Completion date
   - Implementation notes and key findings
   - Any issues encountered or deviations

**Example Workflow:**
```
User: "Complete task E1-T2"
AI: 1. Reads IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md for E1-T2 details
    2. Executes library structure consolidation per acceptance criteria
    3. Updates IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md with completion status
```

This rule ensures proper task tracking and maintains project visibility throughout the improvement process.

### User Requirements & Constraints ðŸ”’
- **Preserve Agent Tooling**: Keep all `.cursor/` directory personas (@pm, @po, @sm) intact
- **Maintain Core Documentation**: Improve through consolidation, not deletion
- **Gradual Implementation**: Perfect execution over speed - no rush needed
- **Testing Priority**: Ensure zero breaks to core functionality
- **AI-Ready Documentation**: Structure for optimal AI analysis and task execution
- **Align with Project Phases**: Follow existing task-tracking.md structure
- **Task Tracking Compliance**: Always read and update IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md

### Agent-Aligned Implementation Strategy

This improvement plan leverages the full agent ecosystem for comprehensive implementation:

**Core Project Agents:**
- **@pm (John - Product Manager)**: Strategic planning, PRD creation, feature prioritization, market analysis
- **@po (Sarah - Product Owner)**: Task validation, quality assurance, process adherence, backlog management  
- **@sm (Bob - Scrum Master)**: Story creation, epic management, developer handoff preparation, agile process

**Specialized Technical Agents:**
- **@analyst (Mary - Business Analyst)**: Market research, competitive analysis, project discovery, brainstorming
- **@architect (Winston - System Architect)**: System design, technology selection, API design, infrastructure planning
- **@dev (James - Full Stack Developer)**: Code implementation, debugging, refactoring, development best practices
- **@qa (Quinn - Senior Developer & QA)**: Code review, testing strategies, quality assurance, mentoring
- **@ux-expert (Sally - UX Expert)**: UI/UX design, wireframes, prototypes, user experience optimization

**Multi-Role Task Assignment:**
Tasks are assigned to primary and supporting agents based on expertise needs. Complex tasks leverage multiple agents collaboratively to ensure comprehensive coverage and quality outcomes.
