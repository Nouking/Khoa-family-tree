### Phase 1: Foundation

**Task 1.11 (P1-CRITICAL): Basic Canvas Component**
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Implemented the basic `FamilyTreeCanvas` component that renders members using absolute positioning and includes a separate SVG layer for connections.
- **Details**: The component now correctly displays family members from the `familyTree` prop and is prepared for connection rendering. This forms the foundational canvas for the new design tool.
- **Issues/Blockers**: None
- **Notes**: This task successfully sets up the initial canvas, enabling subsequent drag-and-drop and connection rendering features.

**Task 1.12 (P1-CRITICAL): Drag-and-Drop Functionality**
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Added drag-and-drop functionality for `MemberBanner` components on the canvas using `react-dnd`.
- **Details**: Integrated `react-dnd` to enable draggable `MemberCard` components within `FamilyTreeCanvas`. Implemented `useDrag` and `useDrop` hooks to manage drag operations and update member positions. Also created mock files for `react-dnd` and `react-dnd-html5-backend` for Jest testing compatibility. The component now correctly updates the member's `position` in the state upon successful drop.
- **Issues/Blockers**: None
- **Notes**: This feature significantly enhances user interaction, allowing for dynamic arrangement of family members on the canvas.

**Task 1.2 (P1-CRITICAL): Data Migration Utility**
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Create a data migration utility to convert existing `family-tree.json` data to the new enhanced format.
- **Details**: Created a script at `family-tree/scripts/migrate-data.ts` that reads the old `family-tree.json`, adds `position`, `size`, and `relationship` fields with default values, and saves the result to `family-tree-v2.json`. The script was successfully executed and then removed along with its temporary tsconfig file.
- **Issues/Blockers**: Encountered and resolved several issues during script execution, including incorrect paths, module resolution errors with `ts-node`, and incorrect data structure assumptions.

**Task 1.1 (P1-CRITICAL): Update TypeScript Interfaces**
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Update TypeScript interfaces with new fields for the design tool, including `position`, `size`, and `relationship`.
- **Details**: This task was discovered to be already implemented. The `family-tree/types/index.ts` file already contains the `position`, `size`, and `relationship` fields in the `FamilyMember` interface, as well as the `TreeSettings` and `FamilyTreeData` interfaces. This work was also tracked under "Task 1.10 - Enhanced Data Structure".
- **Issues/Blockers**: Documentation discrepancy between `task-tracking.md` and `completed-tasks.md`.
- **Notes**: Consolidated task tracking to reflect the completed status.

**Task 1.8** - Page Components Migration  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: AI_Developer
**Description**: Update page components to Next.js 15  
**Issues/Blockers**: None
**Notes**: All page components (`page.tsx`, `login/page.tsx`, `view/page.tsx`, and `layout.tsx`) were reviewed and found to be already compliant with Next.js 15 App Router conventions, correctly using Server and Client Components. No code changes were necessary.

**Task 1.7** - Next.js 15 API Routes
