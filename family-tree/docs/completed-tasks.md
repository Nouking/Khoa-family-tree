    - **TypeScript Compilation**: Resolved 8 compilation errors in v2 components:
      - `usePerformanceMonitor` call signature (removed string parameter)
      - `useVirtualization` interface usage (wrapped viewport in object)
      - Member position property access (`member.x` → `member.position.x`)
      - ItemTypes reference (`FAMILY_MEMBER` → `MEMBER_CARD`)
      - Action types (`CLEAR_SELECTED_MEMBERS` → `SET_SELECTED_MEMBERS`)
      - Function signatures (`moveMember` → `updateMemberPosition`)
      - Property references (removed non-existent `maiden_name`)
    - **Data Flow**: Connected `initialMembers` from server component through client component to canvas
    - **Context Issues**: Fixed prerendering by ensuring proper React context setup

### Epic 11: Notion‑Inspired Modal Color & Motion Polish

<a id="e11-t5"></a>
#### E11‑T5: A11y/Contrast & Test Updates (P1‑CRITICAL)
- Status: Completed - 2025-08-11 | Branch: `improvement-e11-t5-a11y-tests`
- Summary: Updated test suites to assert token/gradient utilities, motion‑reduce behavior, and stable error layout; keyboard flow and mobile bottom‑sheet unaffected.
- Verification Notes:
  - Modal: asserts `u-header-accent--gradient`, backdrop blur tokens, motion‑reduce classes, mobile bottom‑sheet classes, aria-describedby wiring.
  - Add/Edit Modals: primary CTA uses `btn-primary--gradient`; header accent present; no raw hex expectations.
  - MemberForm: asserts `.u-chip--accent`, accented dividers, min-h error containers (no layout shift heuristic).
  - Full suite green except one unrelated jest worker crash in `TreeConnection.test.tsx` on this run; UI tests for E11‑T5 pass consistently. 

<a id="e11-t1"></a>
#### E11‑T1: Gradient & Accent Token Mapping (P1‑CRITICAL)
- Status: Completed - 2025-08-11 | Branch: `improvement-e11-t1-gradient-accent-mapping`
- Summary: Defined minimal, token‑first gradient/accent utilities and documented usage; no raw hex.
- Implementation Notes:
  - Utilities in `app/globals.css`: `.u-header-accent--gradient`, `.u-btn-primary--gradient`, `.u-divider--accent`, `.u-chip--accent`; alias `.btn-primary--gradient` for E11‑T2
  - Spec updates in `family-tree/docs/implementation-notes.md` with OKLCH color‑mix examples and token→usage table

<a id="e11-t2"></a>
#### E11‑T2: Modal Header & Primary CTA Polish (P1‑HIGH)
- Status: Completed - 2025-08-11 | Branch: `improvement-e11-t2-modal-header-cta`
- Summary: Added gradient variant for modal header accent and primary CTA using tokenized utilities. Preserved `.btn-primary` semantics; added `.btn-primary--gradient` with hover/active states and focus-visible outline; respected motion-reduce. Tests updated to assert gradient class.
- Files Modified:
  - `family-tree/app/components/Modal.tsx` (added `headerStyle` prop; gradient toggle for header bar and accent)
  - `family-tree/app/components/AddMemberModal.tsx` (use `headerStyle="gradient"`)
  - `family-tree/app/components/EditMemberModal.tsx` (use `headerStyle="gradient"`)
  - `family-tree/app/components/shared/MemberForm.tsx` (apply `.btn-primary--gradient` + focus-visible + motion-reduce)
  - `family-tree/app/globals.css` (hover/active rules for gradient CTA)
  - `family-tree/app/components/__tests__/Modal.test.tsx` (assert gradient header class)
- Verification Notes:
  - No hardcoded colors introduced; all styles map to `@theme` tokens
  - Focus/keyboard flows unchanged; AA contrast preserved via `--color-primary` and `--color-primary-contrast`
  - Mobile bottom‑sheet unaffected; tests (123/123) pass

- Summary: Introduced tokenized dividers with optional accent, subtle label chips, and decorative section icons to improve scannability in `MemberForm` without functional changes.
- Implementation Notes:
  - Dividers: `border-t border-(--color-neutral-100)` with accent toggle via `[data-accent="true"].border-t { border-color: var(--color-accent) }`
  - Chips: `.u-chip--accent` → `background: color-mix(in oklch, var(--color-accent), white 85%)`, `text-(--color-neutral-800)`; used for labels like “Required”/“Optional”
  - Icons: inline SVG at 16px next to headers, `aria-hidden="true"` when decorative
  - Files Modified: `app/components/shared/MemberForm.tsx`, `app/globals.css`
  - A11y: Decorative icons hidden from SR; any meaningful icons must use `role="img"` + `aria-label`

- Summary: Token-driven hover/press/focus behaviors, section reveal animation respecting prefers-reduced-motion; GPU-friendly transitions; no JS changes.

- Implementation Notes:
  - Buttons: `.btn-primary`, `.btn-outline`, and `.btn-primary--gradient` use tokenized transitions (transform, shadow, background-color) with subtle active feedback (scale .98, elevation-2).
  - Reduced Motion: Added media-query guard to disable transitions/transform/shadow on the above button classes when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set; also ensured gradient variant aligns with accessibility preferences.
  - Section Reveal: Used `@keyframes reveal-fade-up` and `.u-section-reveal` for subtle content entrance. Applied `motion-reduce:animate-none` to modal content container to fully disable the effect when preferred.
  - Performance: Kept animations GPU‑friendly (transform/opacity only) and maintained existing `transform-gpu` usage in modal container to avoid layout thrash; JS logic unchanged.
  - Accessibility: Focus-visible outlines remain token-driven; micro‑interactions respect user motion preferences via Tailwind `motion-reduce:*` utilities and CSS media queries.

- Files Modified:
  - `family-tree/app/globals.css`
  - `family-tree/app/components/Modal.tsx`

- Verification Notes:
  - Full Jest suite passed (11/11, 123/123).
  - Manual check confirms smooth hover/press on desktop; motion-reduce disables micro‑interactions appropriately; no layout shift introduced.
