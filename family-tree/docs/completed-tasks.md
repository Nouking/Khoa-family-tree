## ðŸ“Š Task Completion Log

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Task 1.11 (P1-CRITICAL): Basic Canvas Component**
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Implemented the basic `FamilyTreeCanvas` component that renders members using absolute positioning and includes a separate SVG layer for connections.
- **Details**: The component now correctly displays family members from the `familyTree` prop and is prepared for connection rendering. This forms the foundational canvas for the new design tool.
- **Issues/Blockers**: None
- **Notes**: This task successfully sets up the initial canvas, enabling subsequent drag-and-drop and connection rendering features.

**Task 1.12 (P1-CRITICAL): Drag-and-Drop Functionality**
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Added drag-and-drop functionality for `MemberBanner` components on the canvas using `react-dnd`.
- **Details**: Integrated `react-dnd` to enable draggable `MemberCard` components within `FamilyTreeCanvas`. Implemented `useDrag` and `useDrop` hooks to manage drag operations and update member positions. Also created mock files for `react-dnd` and `react-dnd-html5-backend` for Jest testing compatibility. The component now correctly updates the member's `position` in the state upon successful drop.
- **Issues/Blockers**: None
- **Notes**: This feature significantly enhances user interaction, allowing for dynamic arrangement of family members on the canvas.

**Task 1.2 (P1-CRITICAL): Data Migration Utility**
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Create a data migration utility to convert existing `family-tree.json` data to the new enhanced format.
- **Details**: Created a script at `family-tree/scripts/migrate-data.ts` that reads the old `family-tree.json`, adds `position`, `size`, and `relationship` fields with default values, and saves the result to `family-tree-v2.json`. The script was successfully executed and then removed along with its temporary tsconfig file.
- **Issues/Blockers**: Encountered and resolved several issues during script execution, including incorrect paths, module resolution errors with `ts-node`, and incorrect data structure assumptions.

**Task 1.1 (P1-CRITICAL): Update TypeScript Interfaces**
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Update TypeScript interfaces with new fields for the design tool, including `position`, `size`, and `relationship`.
- **Details**: This task was discovered to be already implemented. The `family-tree/types/index.ts` file already contains the `position`, `size`, and `relationship` fields in the `FamilyMember` interface, as well as the `TreeSettings` and `FamilyTreeData` interfaces. This work was also tracked under "Task 1.10 - Enhanced Data Structure".
- **Issues/Blockers**: Documentation discrepancy between `task-tracking.md` and `completed-tasks.md`.
- **Notes**: Consolidated task tracking to reflect the completed status.

**Task 1.9** - Codemod Application  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: AI_Developer
**Description**: Apply Next.js 15 codemods  
**Issues/Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Use official migration tools. Ran `next-og-import`, `built-in-next-font`, `new-link`, and `metadata-to-viewport-export` codemods.

**Task 1.8** - Page Components Migration  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: AI_Developer
**Description**: Update page components to Next.js 15  
**Issues/Blockers**: None
**Notes**: All page components (`page.tsx`, `login/page.tsx`, `view/page.tsx`, and `layout.tsx`) were reviewed and found to be already compliant with Next.js 15 App Router conventions, correctly using Server and Client Components. No code changes were necessary.

**Task 1.7** - Next.js 15 API Routes  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: AI_Developer
**Description**: Update API routes to Next.js 15 patterns

**Task 1.1** - Setup Next.js Project  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: Setup_Specialist  
**Description**: Setup Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind  
**Issues/Blockers**: Resolved - Missing jose dependency was installed  
**Notes**: Used latest stable versions with App Router. Added proper UI foundation with layout, pages, and components. All authentication dependencies now properly installed.

**Task 1.2** - Project Structure  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: Setup_Specialist  
**Description**: Create basic file structure and directories

**Notes**: All required directories and files created successfully. Project structure follows Next.js 15 App Router conventions with proper organization.

**Task 1.3** - Sample Data Setup  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: Data_Specialist  
**Description**: Setup JSON data files with sample family data  
**Issues/Blockers**: None  
**Notes**: Realistic Vietnamese family data implemented with complete family structure including 6 members with proper relationships, spouse connections, and children hierarchy.

**Task 1.4** - MemberCard Component  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: UI_Developer  
**Description**: Build MemberCard component with photo display  
**Issues/Blockers**: None  
**Notes**: Successfully implemented responsive MemberCard component with photo display and fallback avatar. Component is ready for integration into the tree layout system.

**Task 1.5** - Tree Layout System  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: UI_Developer  
**Description**: Create horizontal tree layout with connections  
**Issues/Blockers**: None  
**Notes**: Successfully implemented horizontally scrollable tree layout with proper generation grouping. Added SVG connections for both parent-child and spouse relationships. Created comprehensive unit tests following TDD principles.

**Task 1.6** - Responsive Design  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: UI_Developer  
**Description**: Add responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop  
**Issues/Blockers**: None  
**Notes**: Successfully implemented responsive design for all device sizes using Tailwind CSS breakpoints. Components and layouts automatically adjust to screen size with viewport detection.

**Task 1.13 (P2-HIGH): Viewport Controls (Pan & Zoom)**
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Implemented viewport controls for panning and zooming the canvas to enhance user interaction.
- **Details**: Added viewport state management to track `x`, `y`, and `zoom` values. Implemented UI controls for zoom-in, zoom-out, and reset functions. Added mouse events to enable canvas panning when dragging. Used CSS transforms for efficient rendering, with transform-origin centered for intuitive zooming. Added a zoom level indicator for user feedback. All controls are visually accessible with hover states for better UX.
- **Issues/Blockers**: None
- **Notes**: This feature significantly improves usability by allowing users to navigate large family trees more efficiently. The implementation includes constraints to prevent extreme zoom levels (0.5x to 2.0x) and smooth transitions for a polished feel.

**Task 2.1** - User Data Setup  
**Status**: Completed | **Agent**: Auth_Specialist  
**Description**: Create users.json with bcrypt hashed passwords
**Issues/Blockers**: None  
**Notes**: Created with bcrypt (10+ salt rounds). This task was originally part of Phase 2 but has been moved to Phase 4's authentication flow.
