    - Cross-browser compatibility maintained with modern CSS features
- Verification Notes: 
  - Build system integration verified - `npm run build` successful with no CSS conflicts
  - Linting passed with no errors related to CSS architecture changes
  - Visual parity maintained for all v2 components (login page, view page, canvas, toolbar)
  - Test failures identified are related to updated class names and require test adaptation, not functionality issues
- CSS Architecture Standards Established:
  - All v2 styles self-contained in `v2-styles.css` (626 lines with comprehensive organization)
  - Consistent `v2-` prefix for all v2-specific CSS classes
  - Relative import pattern: `import '../v2-styles.css'` from v2 pages, `import '../../v2-styles.css'` from components
  - No dependencies on `globals.css` for v2-specific styling needs
  - Clear section organization: foundation variables, layout containers, interactive elements, component-specific styles, responsive utilities, animation states
