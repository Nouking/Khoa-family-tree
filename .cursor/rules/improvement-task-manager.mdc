# Improvement Task Manager Rule

This rule is ALWAYS ACTIVE and enforces proper task tracking workflow for any improvement-related tasks.

## Mandatory Task Workflow

**CRITICAL RULE - APPLIES TO ALL AI INTERACTIONS:**

When any task from IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md is mentioned or requested:

### Step 1: Task Discovery (MANDATORY)
```
BEFORE implementing any improvement task, AI MUST:
1. Read @IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md to fetch complete task details
2. Locate the specific task (e.g., E1-T2, E2-T1) in the tracking document
3. Review acceptance criteria, dependencies, and implementation details
4. Verify all prerequisites are met before proceeding
```

### Step 2: Task Execution
```
DURING task implementation:
1. Follow the acceptance criteria exactly as specified
2. Use the designated git branch naming convention
3. Implement per the detailed implementation steps
4. Run all required tests and validations
```

### Step 3: Task Completion (MANDATORY)
```
AFTER completing any improvement task, AI MUST:
1. Update @IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md immediately
2. Change task status from "Pending/In Progress" to "Completed"
3. Add completion date in format: YYYY-MM-DD
4. Document implementation notes and key findings
5. Record any issues encountered or deviations from plan
6. Update any dependencies that are now unblocked
```

## Enforcement Rules

- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This workflow is mandatory for all improvement tasks
- **BLOCKING**: AI cannot skip task tracking steps for efficiency
- **VALIDATION**: Always verify task details from IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md before starting
- **COMPLETION**: Task is not complete until tracking document is updated

## Example Usage

```
User: "Complete library consolidation task"
AI: 1. Reads IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md for E1-T2 details ✅
    2. Executes library structure consolidation per acceptance criteria ✅  
    3. Updates IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md with completion status ✅
```

## Integration with Agent Personas

This rule works alongside @pm, @po, @sm personas:
- **@pm**: Strategic task planning and prioritization
- **@po**: Task validation and quality assurance  
- **@sm**: Story preparation and developer handoff

All agent personas MUST follow this task tracking workflow when working on improvement tasks.
