- UI of Add/edit modal is ugly, the current UI is file example\UI-family-tree-09-08-2025_add_modal.jpg, use role .cursor\rules\ux-expert.mdc with support from .cursor\rules\architect.mdc and .cursor\rules\po.mdc, create epic with detail in formation to improve current UI, make it colorful, good looking UI.
Write new epic/task in file IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md with really detail on each, so AI can work perfect with it. Discuss with me if needed
