- Discuss with me if needed for plan improve current UI to new design which memtioned above. @QA @PM @PO @UX-expert and @architect @SM discuss with each other and me.
Plan detail first then create a Improve UI MD file. Can move UI-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md and IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md to a archived folder in docs folder. Then create a new UI improve plan md file. Plan epic and story can create later.
Do not create new epic and story, create a good UI improve plan 1st.
