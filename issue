- UI of Add/edit modal is ugly, I need UI more colorful, beauty, can refer to this web https://www.notion.com/?ref=godly, use role .cursor\rules\ux-expert.mdc with support from .cursor\rules\architect.mdc and .cursor\rules\po.mdc, create epic with detail in formation to improve current UI, make it colorful, good looking UI.
Write new epic/task in file IMPROVEMENT-TASK-TRACKING.md with really detail on each, so AI can work perfect with it. Discuss with me if needed.

Clarify before I write/update tasks: subtle accents.
Gradients: allow soft OKLCH gradients in headers/CTAs: yes.
Accent color family: keep current primary (warm blue) as hero, and allow accent pink for highlights:yes.
 Notion vs. godly vibe: minimalist with selective color, or more expressive (chips, gradient headers, colored dividers): more expressive.
 Motion: subtle transitions only, or add a few micro‑interactions (focus/press states, section reveal): add a few micro‑interactions.
